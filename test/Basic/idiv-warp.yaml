# RUN: dxc -T cs_6_0 -Fo %t.dxil %S/Inputs/idiv.hlsl
# RUN: %gpu-exec %s %t.dxil -warp | FileCheck %s

# REQUIRES: DirectX-WARP
# The behavior of division by zero and edge cases for division by negative one
# is undefined in HLSL with SM 6.0. WARP's behavior is different from other
# drivers so it is captured separately in this test.
